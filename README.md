# Inverted-Indexing
The "Automatic Inverted Indexing of Web Pages" repository aims to automate the process of creating an inverted index for a collection of web pages. This involves crawling and storing a minimum of 1000 web pages, extracting meta information such as web page ID, URI, title, and description keywords, and preprocessing the textual content.
